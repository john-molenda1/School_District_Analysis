# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was because Maria and her supervisor at the school board suspected academic dishonesty surrounding reading and math scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School. We initially ran an analysis for the district for all students, to determine average math, reading, and overall passing scores for every school, grade (9th - 12th), and category of school (charter or district). Then, we replaced all the math and reading scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School with null values to check for academic dishonest and ran the results again to see if there was a difference in the two datasets. 

## Analysis 
The following section describes how individual sections of our code were affected by the removal of 9th grade math & reading scores at Thomas High School

### District Summary 
The district summary was changed slightly in the fact that the average math score decreased by .04% (from 78.985% 78.931%) and average reading score decreased from 81.878% to 81.856%. Overall, there were a minor decrease in percentage of students who passed math as 74.98% of students had passed math before the data refactoring, whereas 74.76% passed math in the district with the removal of the 9th grade THS students. The percentae of students who passed reading saw a similar minor decrease from 85.81% passing to 85.66%. Obviously, with both the percentage of studings passing either math or reading, the overall percentage of students who were passing both declined from 65.17% to 64.86%
