# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was because Maria and her supervisor at the school board suspected academic dishonesty surrounding reading and math scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School. We initially ran an analysis for the district for all students, to determine average math, reading, and overall passing scores for every school, grade (9th - 12th), and category of school (charter or district). Then, we replaced all the math and reading scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School with null values to check for academic dishonest and ran the results again to see if there was a difference in the two datasets.
